> **Fun Fact**: In times of conflict, humor often becomes a shield, allowing individuals to confront the harsh realities of war. As noted in a study on humor during wartime, "There is nothing funny about war and suffering, but if we laugh at some aspects of the horrors of war, we regain a new perspective of human existence." :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
